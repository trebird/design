      <p class="hello-intro milli">I'm Treawna, an artist, designer (musician, nutritionist) and photographer based in Ottawa, Canada. I specialize in obsessing over the fine details while calmly translating information into pleasing visual experiences!</p>
      <p class="milli hello-text push">I have always felt best when learning and creating, and design has provided endless opportunity to do both. I love that each mind processes information so differently, and Iâ€™m grateful to collaborate with others through a process of empathy, understanding and creating.</p>
      <p class="milli hello-text push-2">Other activities include spending time in nature, cold showers, collecting books at an inversely proportional rate to reading them, thanking loved ones profusely for feeding me while I code this website. Additionally, listening to a playlist titled <i>Seth Cohen Starter Pack</i> while coding this website.</p>
