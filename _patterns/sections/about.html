      <p class="hello-intro milli">I'm a designer (musician, nutritionist) and photographer based in Ottawa, Canada.
        I specialize in obsessing over fine details while calmly translating information into pleasing visual experiences!
        Specifically, my areas of focus are <span class="specialty">branding</span>, <span class="specialty">web</span> and <span class="specialty">UX/UI</span> design.</p>
      <p class="milli hello-text push">I feel best while learning and creating, so I appreciate that design provides infinite opportunities to do both.
        I am also inspired by how each mind processes information differently and am grateful to collaborate with others through empathy, understanding and translation to the visual.
        I like to be highly detail-oriented in each of these stages to produce meaningful work that speaks to each client and project's intended message.</p>
      <p class="milli hello-text push-2">Apart from design, I love reading, continuous learning, working on myself, spending time in nature, and,
        when it is safe to do so, making and playing music with <span class="haig">
