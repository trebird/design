      <p class="hello-intro">I'm Treawna, an artist, designer, (musician, nutritionist and photographer) based in Ottawa, Canada. I specialize in obsessing over the fine details while calmly translating information into pleasing visual experiences!</p>
      <p class="milli hello-text push">I have always felt best when learning and creating, and design has provided endless opportunity for both. I love that each mind processes information so differently, so I am grateful to collaborate with others through a process of empathy, understanding and creating.</p>
      <p class="milli hello-text push-2">Other activities include collecting books at an inversely proportional rate to their reading, editing images at 200 percent for too long before catching myself, thanking loved ones profusely for feeding me while I code this website. Additionally, listening to the <i>Seth Cohen Starter Pack</i> playlist while coding this website.</p>
